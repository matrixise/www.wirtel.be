Welcome on the source code of St√©phane Wirtel's blog

This one uses [Hugo](https://www.gohugo.io) and the [Ghostwriter theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/ghostwriter/)

I use Netlify for the deployment

Status: [![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/c67c87b3-bc74-4667-b63f-d235ae5516fd/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/stephane-wirtel/deploys)


For the CV, this one is build via the GitHub actions and stored on AWS S3.
