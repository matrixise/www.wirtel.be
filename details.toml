At the European Investment Bank (EIB), several Python tools were developed to support credit risk modelling and financial data workflows.
The work began with the creation of a multi-interface demonstrator exposing a shared risk library via CLI, FastAPI, Vue.js, Excel (xlwings), and Python.
This was followed by the development of Protog, a credit risk engine computing Expected Losses (both analytical and Monte Carlo), with support for tranching, pari passu, WAVG, and remuneration spreads.
DataTreatment, an ETL pipeline, was built to standardize heterogeneous Excel datasets using Pandera and Pandas, feeding modelling and dashboarding tools.
Additional tools include Cashflow Generator (reporting) and Cashflow-Rebucketer (cashflow normalization).
All tools provide Excel and CLI integration, follow strong engineering standards (typing, testing, profiling, documentation), and are actively used by EIB teams on a daily basis."""
