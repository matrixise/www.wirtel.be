I am a dedicated professional currently employed at the European Investment Bank (EIB) in Luxembourg. In my role, I have the privilege of working on a transformative project aimed at supporting quantitative analysts (quants) in creating robust and scalable business applications using Python.

## Job Responsibilities:

As a key member of the EIB's technology team, I play a pivotal role in collaborating with quants to bridge the gap between complex quantitative models and practical, efficient applications. My primary responsibilities include:

* Collaborating closely with quants to understand their requirements and objectives.
* Developing Python-based applications that are not only stable but also capable of handling substantial scaling to meet the bank's evolving needs.
* Ensuring the reliability and robustness of these applications, aligning them with the highest industry standards.
* Providing ongoing support and enhancements to maintain the optimal performance of these business applications.
