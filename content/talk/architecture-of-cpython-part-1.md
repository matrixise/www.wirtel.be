## About

From a small example of code, we will generate the bytecode with the compiler, we will study the generated bytecode with the tools of CPython and especially we will see the execution of this bytecode by the virtual machine with a modified version of CPython, just for this talk.This talk is based on my previous talk "Exploring our Python Interpreter" but in this talk, we will go more in the details of the interpreter and especially of the virtual machine.
