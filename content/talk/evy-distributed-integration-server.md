## About

The idea behind this talk, is the presentation of a solution for the Odoo Runbot.

For the experimented user of Odoo, we know there is a limitation with the current version of the runbot, this one is not scallable.

It can execute a lot of processes in background, but we can not executed them on several machines.
In this case, this presentation is just a collection of small ideas for the improvements of the runbot.
