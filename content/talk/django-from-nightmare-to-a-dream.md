## About

With the adventure in the source code of the site of EuroPython, we have
detected that the code was difficult to maintain. With the members of the Web
team, we have started to refactor the code with the best practices and good
concept. Also, we will see some awesome libraries for the Django project.

In brief, you have a legacy code and you want to improve it with best practices,
then this talk is for you.

You don’t want to break it but you don’t want to change it because you can break
it at all times, we will show you how to improve an existing code with some
tools and best practices, and your code can be deploy on Friday evening with no
risk.

From a nightmare to a dream.

Keywords, TDD, Refactoring, Tests, BDD, Selenium, CI, and many more

After this conference, the source code of EuroPython has been improved. From 0
tests, now we have +- 100 tests and a code coverage of 32%.

We have organized a sprint code for the project and we have had some sprinters.

Thank you so much,
