# Events in 2017

Hello, for the PythonFOSDEM [1] on 4th and 5th February in Belgium, I would like to present some slides with the Python events around the World. Based on https://python.org/events, I have noted that there are missing events, for example:

* PyCon Otto: Italy
* PyCon UK: United Kingdom
* PyCon CA: Canada
* PyCon Ireland: Ireland
* PyCon France: France

Some of these events are not yet announced and I understand they are in the second semester, and thus, they don't know the location and the dates, excepted for PyCon Otto (April).

In fact, I have noted that we know some big events in the Python community (for example: PyCon US and EuroPython) but do you know the others events, maybe the local event, PyCon IE, PyCon UK or PyCon IT.

I like to know where there is a PyCon or a Django Conf or a PyData Event.

In fact, I think we can help the Python Community if we submit all the events in https://python.org/events.

This page has been created by the PSF and is maintained by some volunteers.

I am also working on a t-shirt for the Python events in 2017

If you think there is a missing event, please, send me the info via [email](mailto:stephane@wirtel.be) or via my [twitter account](https://twitter.com/matrixise) and I will add it on my slides.

Thank you so much for your help.
