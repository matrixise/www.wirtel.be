# Introduction

Since 2 years, I used Pelican, a very good project developed by a team of good
developers. You have a lot of plugins, everything works fine but, and yes, there
is a "but". In fact, when you want to update your blog, and try to use the last
version of Pelican, you can have some errors. It's the case with the
pelican-social plugin and the last version of Pelican.

Ok, you can try to use the old version, and then we can start the witch hunt and
try to find the right version of the Pelican with this plugin.

In fact, this is not the first time I have this issue, and sincerely, I don't
want to waste my time with this kind of problems. So, I decided to test an other
static site generator.

# Why ?

1. Pelican is great and if you want to use a plugin, install it. But if you have
   a problem with this plugin, you have to uninstall it. With hugo, everything
   is builtin in the core of the project, you have a compilation step, but when
   you have the final binary, just execute it and don't worry, it works fine.

2. Hugo is so fast! When I am editing a post, I can have the result in realtime.

# Conclusion

If you like Pelican, stay with this tool, Pelican is an awesome tool if you want
to write your own blog, the architecture is really amazing, you have the
documents, the readers and the writers. you can extend it easily with the
docutils lib. You can implement a new directive for the Restructured Text format
and it's really awesome.

I just want to test an other tool and see the difference.

See you later, maybe in the future I will return to Pelican or Jekyll, but I
want to test it.

Bye Pelican, see you later, maybe.
