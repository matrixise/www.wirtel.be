Because I want to be in advance this year for the organization of the PythonFOSDEM 2018,
I have worked on the [web site](https://python-fosdem.org). The Call for Proposals will be announced once we have the "Go" from FOSDEM.

So, the site is already prepared, and now, I will wait for the notification from FOSDEM for the next devroom.

I hope the answer will be positive.

I will continue to keep you informed.

Have a nice day,

St√©phane
