**Why I Haven’t Been Active for 3 Years**

The past few years have brought many changes and challenges in my life. I’d like to share what has happened.

## Family

In 2021, I lost my grandparents, which was a difficult time for me and my family. More recently, in July 2023, my younger brother passed away, which has been a heartbreaking experience. On top of that, my mother battled cancer from September 2022 to June 2023, but thankfully, she is now in remission. Just two weeks ago, we also lost one of my uncles, adding to the grief. It has been a tough period, but I’m grateful for the support around me.

## Python

Over the past few years, I paused almost all of my contributions to various projects, except for **[PyCon Ireland](https://www.python.ie) 2023 and 2024**, where I remained actively involved. I also continued to maintain **[Python Planet](https://planet.python.org)**, though the updates were less frequent. This break allowed me to take a step back while still staying connected with the Python community through events and projects that I continue to follow closely.

## Work

From September 2021 to July 2022, I worked for a company called **Ipify**, which focuses on end-to-end intellectual property management. It was a fascinating experience. Then, **at the end of 2022**, I signed a contract with the **[European Investment Bank (EIB)](https://www.eib.org/en/)** as an external Python consultant. My role involves bringing Python into the banking sector, which has been both an exciting and rewarding project.

## Sport

On the personal side, I’ve continued to invest time in Karate, a passion that helps me stay balanced. Recently, I achieved my **2nd DAN in Karate JKA**, a milestone I’m incredibly proud of. This accomplishment holds special meaning for me, as I dedicated it to my younger brother, who passed away far too soon. Additionally, I’ve become a **Karate referee**, which has been an incredible journey. It has allowed me to experience the sport from a different perspective, honing my decision-making skills under pressure.

## Health

To achieve my 1st and 2nd DANs, I lost a significant amount of weight, but recently I’ve been struggling with some yo-yo effects and it’s been difficult to maintain my focus. It’s a bit frustrating, especially since I no longer enjoy wearing my slim shirts as much! 😊 But I’m working on regaining my balance and stabilizing my health.

## Future

Looking ahead, I plan to return to the Python community by writing more blog posts and creating YouTube videos to share my knowledge. I’m also considering launching Python training courses to help others learn the language. Additionally, I will continue my consultancy work, bringing Python to more projects and industries. It’s an exciting time, and I’m eager to reconnect with the community and share more through different platforms.
