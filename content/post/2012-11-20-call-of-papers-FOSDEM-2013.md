This year, Python will be represented by its Community. If you want to
discuss with a lot of Python Users, it's the place to be in February !

Like every year, [FOSDEM](http://fosdem.org/2013/) will take place the
**first week-end of February** in **Brussels** (Belgium).

We will have a room in the K building (**80 seats**). This dev room will
be open all day **Sunday, February 3rd**.

If you want to hold a session in the Python devroom, please go to the
[python-fosdem](http://python-fosdem.org) web site and fill the survey.

**Call for Papers is open until December 21st**

This year, the submissions will be reviewed by a committee:

Thank you for submitting your sessions and see you soon in Brussels to
