# Weekly Update 

## In General
Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday

Started to use [pytest-odoo](https://github.com/camptocamp/pytest-odoo) from
camptocamp for the tests with [Odoo](https://github.com/odoo/odoo). So, I don't
like some stuffs and I think to submit fixes.

I worked on a [cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter) template
for Odoo, you have to give a json file to the command and this one will generate
a fully installable addon for Odoo 12.

Wednesday, I was sick on the morning :( headache, I stayed and worked at home.

Thursday, because I have a lot of fixtures for Django and because I have to
convert them to the Odoo XML, I need to develop a script for that. I have played
with [Bonobo](https://www.bonobo-project.org). It's a powerful ETL written in
Python, and of course I wanted to use.

Friday morning, just play with a new converter, from csv to the Odoo XML format,
in one hour, you have a runnable solution.

## About Python

Of course, I have fixed small issues and I continued to work on my "awaiting
changes" pull requests.

On Friday evening, I will take a plane, destination Bratislava in Slovakia üá∏üá∞
for [PyCon Slovakia](https://2019.pycon.sk/sk/). I will present my talk "What's
new in Python 3.7?" (you can check the
[schedule](https://2019.pycon.sk/en/saturday.html)). I am happy, that will be my
first time in Slovakia, new country for me and I will
discover the culture and the üêç Python community.

For the second time this year, I am invited by the organizers, I am really
happy.

Cheers,

St√©phane
