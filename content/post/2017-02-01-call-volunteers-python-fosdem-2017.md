# Introduction

The Python Community will be represented during FOSDEM 2017 with the Python Devrooms.
This year, we will have two devrooms, the first one for 150 people on Saturday and the second one for 450 people on Sunday, it's really cool because we had accepted 24 talks instead of 16.

This is the official call for sessions for the [Python devroom](https://www.python-fosdem.org) at [FOSDEM 2017](https://fosdem.org/2017)
from **4th** to **5th** February 2017.

FOSDEM is the Free and Open source Software Developer's European Meeting, a free
and non-commercial two-day week-end that offers open source contributors a place
to meet, share ideas and collaborate.

It's the biggest event in Europe with +5000 hackers, +400 speakers.

For this edition, Python will be represented by its Community. If you want to
discuss with a lot of Python Users, it's the place to be!

But we have an issue, we need some volunteers because on the week-end, we will only be 4 volunteers.

If you think you can help us, please fill this [Google Form](https://goo.gl/forms/IOmGbEgFLVnmUGjO2)

Thank you so much for your help
