# Introduction

In June 2016, I have received an email from the Board of the Python Software Foundation, where they informed me I have received a [Community Service Award](https://www.python.org/community/awards/psf-awards/#june-2016).

Seriously, I was glad to receive this award.

I don't know how to describe this moment.

After that, the PSF has written a [blog post](http://pyfound.blogspot.be/2016/08/in-beginning-there-was-one-python-group.html) about me.

# Conference

And with this award, the PSF has offered me the ticket for the conference.

# Award

Dear Python Software Foundation,

Thank you so much,
