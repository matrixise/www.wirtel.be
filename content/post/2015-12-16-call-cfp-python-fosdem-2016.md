# Introduction

The Python Community has a devroom during the FOSDEM in Brussels in Belgium. The
event will take place during the last week-end of January 2016.

With the success of the previous PythonFOSDEM, this year we received a bigger
room of 363 seats.

But to be honnest, for this PythonFOSDEM, we have only received 8 proposals for
16 available slots.

Becuse the deadline is imminent and because we have only received some
proposals, we have extended the deadline at 20 December.

Please, submit your proposals, don't hesitate.

Topics:

* Asynchronous
* Cloud
* Databases
* Frameworks
* Librairies
* Networks
* Python internals (Interpreters, ...)
* Web frameworks (Django, Pyramid, Flask, etc...)
* etc...
