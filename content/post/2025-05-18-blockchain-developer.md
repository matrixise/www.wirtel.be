✨ **A New Milestone!**

I'm proud to share that I’ve completed the **Blockchain Developer** program at [Alyra – The School of Blockchain and AI](https://www.alyra.fr/), and officially joined the **Galilée cohort** 🚀

These past few months have been much more than a technical training.  
It was an in-depth journey into a transformative technology — **Web3** — that challenges how we build, think, and collaborate.

## 🧭 Why Blockchain?

Blockchain is not just about smart contracts and tokens.  
It’s a **powerful tool to bring transparency, traceability, and trust** back into our systems.

Here’s what it enables:

- 🔍 Every action is **traceable and verifiable**
- 🧩 Exchanges between stakeholders are **frictionless and secured**
- 🤝 Trust can be established **without intermediaries**
- ⚖️ Governance models become **more open and collaborative**

Integrating blockchain into real-world projects means more than just being innovative.  
It’s about **giving purpose to processes**, **enhancing transparency**, and **building fairer, more resilient models**.

## 💡 Final Project: **Shin Gi Tai**

Our team built **Shin Gi Tai**, a system that **digitizes martial arts grades and attendance**, using blockchain.

### 🔧 Tech stack:
- 🔐 Smart contracts in **Solidity** (Ethereum & Gnosis Chain)
- 🎖️ **NFTs** to represent grades, **SFTs** for attendance tracking
- 🧾 **Tamper-proof proof of participation**
- 🧑‍💻 Frontend built with **Next.js / React**, using **Wagmi**, **Viem**, **TailwindCSS**, and **ShadCN**
- 🌐 Web3 integration: wallet connection, minting, on-chain data reading

---

## 🔗 Why Build This on Blockchain?

Because blockchain allows us to **guarantee the authenticity, transparency, and traceability** of data — without relying on a centralized authority.

In the case of *Shin Gi Tai*, every grade, every attendance at an event, every personal commitment is **timestamped, verifiable, and immutable**.

It’s a tangible way to **strengthen trust** between federations, clubs, and practitioners — and to provide a **sovereign, long-lasting, and interoperable digital recognition**.

This project gave me the opportunity to explore Web3 end-to-end:  
from **on-chain backend**, to **smart contract logic**, all the way to **user-facing Web3 interfaces**.
