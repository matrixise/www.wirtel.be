# PyCon France 2017

[PyCon France](http://www.pycon.fr) is the annual Python Conference in **France** for the **French Community**, and this year, the conference will be in **Toulouse**, a town in the south of France, **from 21st to 24th September**.

and for PyConFR 2017, I submitted 3 talks, and they have been accepted:

# Talks
1. Talk: "Va débugger ton Python!"
2. Talk: "Django, d'un cauchemard à un rêve, avec de Bonnes Pratiques"
3. Talk: "As-tu déjà pensé à contribuer à CPython"


## "Va débugger ton Python!"

English: "Go and debug your Python!"

In this talk, I will explain how to debug your Python script with your underestimated debugger, in this case, `gdb` but of course, I will show `pdb` and others tools.
If you think the `print()` function is your best friend, then this talk is for you, because `gdb` is really awesome.

* `pdb`
* `gdb`

## "Django, d'un cauchemard à un rêve, avec de Bonnes Pratiques"

English: *Drango, from nigthmare to dream with best practices*

This talk has been showed during the last EuroPython 2017 in Rimini, where I took a real use-case, and started to dissect a web site written with Django.
In fact, it can be with Django or with another tool, but the most important thing, this talk is just a bunch of good tools for your help.

* dev server
* profiling
* testing
* best practices

## "As-tu déjà pensé à contribuer à CPython"

English: *Hey, let's contribute to CPython*

And the last one, maybe the most important for me, because I love `CPython`, in this talk, I will share my experience with `CPython`, and will explain how to contribute to `CPython`, by Code, by Documentation or just with a conference (this one).

I will explain the difference with the old tool chain ([b.p.o](https://bugs.python.org) and the old-way for the patches), now we have [Github](https://www.github.com/python/cpython) and it's awesome.

And with this talk, I would like to organize a Sprint about CPython on Friday 22nd September.

See you there,
