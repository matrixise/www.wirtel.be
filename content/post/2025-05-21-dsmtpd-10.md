🧵 **From script to version 1.0.0 — 12 years later**  

In 2013, I wrote a tiny Python script to help with local SMTP debugging during development.  It used `smtpd`, `docopt`, and had no ambition other than making my day a little easier.  
  
This tiny helper evolved into a CLI tool: [dsmtpd](https://github.com/matrixise/dsmtpd)  Then, I forgot about it.

## 🧹 2021: Minor cleanup, no big plans  
  
Eight years later, I dusted it off:  
- Removed `docopt`  
- Dropped Python 2.x support  
- Cleaned up the CLI a bit  
- Pushed version **0.3**  
  
And once again, the tool went dormant.

## ⚡ 2025: A wild pull request appears  
  
Fast forward to 2025:  I receive a PR from [Sebastian Wagner](https://github.com/sebix) to replace the deprecated `smtpd` module with `aiosmtpd`, now required for Python 3.12+.  
  
The PR was 🔥:  
- Clean and focused  
- Added basic test coverage  
- Included a `systemd` service file  
- Brought the project back to life

## 🏁 Result: Version 1.0.0 released  
  
Twelve years after the first commit, I officially tagged **v1.0.0**.  📅 Release date: **May 20, 2025**

## 🍒 The cherry on top?  
  
Turns out `dsmtpd` has been running in **production** — quietly, usefully — for years.  No one told me. No compensation. No feedback. Just... usage.  
  
That’s the beauty (and irony) of open source.

## 💡 Reflections  
  
- Even the tiniest utility script can have long-term impact.  
- Open source is full of quiet users and surprise contributors.  
- Sometimes, one well-placed `git tag v1.0.0` is all it takes to honor the journey.

If you’re like me and you enjoy keeping small tools alive — or watching them get resurrected years later — I’d love to hear your stories.
