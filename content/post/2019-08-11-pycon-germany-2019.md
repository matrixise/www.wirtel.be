# Speaker at PyCon.DE 2019

Voilà, during the last week, I received very good news, I will be a speaker at
[PyCon.DE 2019](https://pycon.de) in Berlin in October 2019.

I will present my new talk [What's new in Python 3.8?]({{< ref "/talk/what-is-new-in-python-38.md" >}}) 

So, good luck to the other speakers and I hope to see you there.

Stéphane
