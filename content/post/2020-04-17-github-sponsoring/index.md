# What's a Github Sponsor?

From the [FAQ](https://help.github.com/en/github/supporting-the-open-source-community-with-github-sponsors/about-github-sponsors)

> GitHub Sponsors allows the developer community to financially support the people 
> and organizations who design, build, and maintain the open source projects 
> they depend on, directly on GitHub.

And because I like to use and develop Open Sources projects, I wanted to contribute and help maintainers.

# GitHub Sponsoring
There is one month ago, via my company [Mgx.io](https://mgx.io), I have started to sponsor some developers via the Github Sponsorship.

It's really easy and safe.

1. If you like a project, just click on the button "Sponsor" of the maintainer of the project
2. Pay via the Github process
3. Receive the invoice
4. Send it to your accountant.

It's an other form of contributing for the open source ecosystem.

## Sponsoring is for ...

* [Ned Batchelder](https://github.com/nedbat), maintainer of [Coverage.py](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy)
* [Alex Goodman](https://github.com/wagoodman), maintainer of [Dive](https://github.com/wagoodman/dive)

## Projects

### Coverage.py

Code coverage testing for Python.

Repo: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy

### Dive

Tool for exploring each layer in a docker image. For my part, it's useful because I detect issues with my docker images.

Repo: https://github.com/wagoodman/dive


Cheers,

Stéphane
