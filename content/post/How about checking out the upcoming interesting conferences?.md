Here are the upcoming conferences that interest me.

1. [Odoo Experience 2025]: I think I’ll go tomorrow, it’s been a long time since I last attended. The last time I was part of the team was back in 2014, when I posted a picture of myself as an Odoo Warrior ;-). And I went back in 2015 just to say hello to my former colleagues. I often think about my old coding buddies, and I’ll try to visit them tomorrow.
   - **Date**: September 18–20, 2025
   - **Location**: Brussels Expo
   - **Country**: Belgium

2. [PyCon France 2025]: A conference I used to attend every year as a speaker. I haven’t participated since 2019 — maybe it’s time to return.
   - **Date**: October 30 – November 2, 2025
   - **Location**: Lyon
   - **Country**: France

3. [PyCon Ireland 2025]: A conference I’ve been attending since 2014, without any exceptions except for the COVID years. At first, I joined as a simple attendee, and later, as a co-organizer. Now, I’m kind of retired from the team — not much time left to be actively involved.
   - **Date**: November 14–15, 2025
   - **Location**: Dublin
   - **Country**: Ireland

So, I think these are the conferences I’d really like to attend. If you see me there, I’ll be happy to catch up.

Have a great day,

Stéphane
