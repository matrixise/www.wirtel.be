Because I want to be in advance this year for the organization of the PythonFOSDEM 2018,
I have worked on the [web site](https://python-fosdem.org). The Call for Proposals will be announced once we have the "Go" from FOSDEM.

In fact, for 2018, I do not know if we will have a room at FOSDEM, because during PythonFOSDEM 2017, we have received a sponsoring from [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com) and the organizers of FOSDEM were angry, because the sponsoring was for 1000 free beers ;-)

So, the site is already prepared, and now, I will wait for the notification from FOSDEM for the next devroom.

I hope the answer will be positive.

I will continue to keep you informed.

Have a nice day,

St√©phane
