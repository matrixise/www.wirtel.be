# New Year's Python Meme 2012

## 1. What's the coolest Python application, framework or library you discovered in 2012?

- VirtualEnv (virtualenvwrapper) - This tool is really awesome. You can
  create a new environment for your testing and development. It's really
  useful if you want to contribute to a Python project. Just run `python
  setup develop` and you're ready to go.
- Requests (by [Kenneth Reitz](http://kennethreitz.com)) is a real
  advantage when you develop an HTTP client because urllib is quite
  cumbersome.
- Python-RQ (by [Vincent Driessen](http://nvie.com)) - You can create a
  PubSub with Redis, and it's easy.
- Gunicorn (by [Benoit Chesneau](http://twitter.com/benoitc)) - A very
  good WSGI server. I use it for my own projects. This WSGI server can be
  included in your own project via the Python API.

If you want to monitor your processes you can use these tools.

- Circus (by [Tarek Ziade](http://ziade.org) and the [Mozilla
  Foundation](http://mozilla.org))
- Gaffer (by [Benoit Chesneau](http://twitter.com/benoitc))

## 2. What new programming technique did you learn in 2012?

- I learned asynchronous programming with gevent and python-rq. These
  libraries are really awesome.
- Before December 2012, I didn't use GitHub except to fetch the source
  code of several projects.

## 3. Which open source project did you contribute to the most in 2012? What did you do?

[OpenERP](http://openerp.com) - I have been a core developer for 5 years.
I also contributed to Python via [PythonFOSDEM](http://python-fosdem.org).

I organized a Python devroom at [FOSDEM 2013](http://fosdem.org/2013)
with some friends. It's really great for the Python community, and we want
to improve the visibility of Python.

If you want to contribute, the repository is on
[GitHub](http://github.com/matrixise/python-fosdem.org)

## 4. Which Python blog or website did you read the most in 2012?

The Python section of [Reddit](http://reddit.com),
[Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com), and sometimes
[HumanCoders](http://news.humancoders.com/), where you can find a lot of
great articles.

## 5. What are the three top things you want to learn in 2013?

- [Gateway](http://github.com/matrixise/gateway) - Based on python-rq,
  this library is a tool to exchange data from one source to one
  destination via the concept of Workers.
- [PrintUs](http://github.com/matrixise/printus) - This is a prototype of
  a printing server based on pyzmq.
- [LLVM](http://llvm.org) - I implemented a small interpreter for a
  minimalist Lisp language, and I would like to compile it with LLVM.
- The foundation of the python network programming.
- Erlang
- Go
- Scala

## 6. What is the top software, application or library you wish someone would write in 2013 ?

- A CMS based on Python and Flask
- a wiki based on git and python (flask) and with the reStructuredText
  support
