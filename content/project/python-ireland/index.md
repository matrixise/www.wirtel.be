I am happy to help the Python Ireland team. I think I will be in charge of the new website and help them with some other things.

I will help for the different PyCon (Dublin, Limerick) and the meetups.

In fact, for the small story, it's not my first time in Ireland, I like to travel to Dublin and discuss with the Irish people. Also, I started to be a speaker at PyCon Ireland since 2014...

Some PyCons and one meetup in Dublin.
