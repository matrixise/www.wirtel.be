PythonFOSDEM is a small conference in Brussels during FOSDEM.

FOSDEM is organised by developers for developers. During FOSDEM, the organisers
propose some rooms for some topics. In this case, the Python project has a room
for one day and we can organise some talks.

Since 2013, PythonFOSDEM is organised by some friends and myself. From 80
people, we have reached 800 people.
