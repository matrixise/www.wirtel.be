## Description

The Python Software Foundation (PSF) is a 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation that holds the intellectual property rights behind the Python programming language. We manage the open source licensing for Python version 2.1 and later and own and protect the trademarks associated with Python. We also run the North American PyCon conference annually, support other Python conferences around the world, and fund Python-related development with our grants program and by funding special projects.

## Status

* [Fellow Member](https://www.python.org/psf/members/) of the [Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/psf/) since 2013

## Contributions

* I became a Fellow of the PSF in 2013 after launching the **Python DevRoom at FOSDEM**—a key initiative that gave Python a regular presence at one of Europe’s largest open source conferences.
* Since 2018, a **superb team of volunteers** has taken over the coordination of the Python DevRoom at FOSDEM. They continue to promote Python passionately, curate great talks, and strengthen the community presence at this flagship event.
* Member of the **PSF Fellow Work Group** (active)
* Conferences for Python ([PythonFOSDEM](https://python-fosdem.org))
* Volunteer for PyCon
* Member of the **PSF Marketing Work Group** (inactive)

## About FOSDEM

[FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org) (Free and Open Source Developers’ European Meeting) is one of the largest and most respected free software conferences in the world. Held annually in Brussels, it brings together thousands of open source contributors, maintainers, and community members from around the globe. FOSDEM is entirely volunteer-organized and **100% free to attend**.

The conference is known for its **Developer Rooms (DevRooms)**—community-organized tracks focused on specific technologies or languages. By founding and maintaining the Python DevRoom at FOSDEM, I helped Python gain a strong and recurring presence at this major event, creating opportunities for talks, sprints, and community outreach across Europe.

## Award

* In May 2017, I received a CSA (Community Service Award) from the [Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/psf/) for my contribution to the Python ecosystem with [PythonFOSDEM](https://python-fosdem.org) and other events in Belgium.
