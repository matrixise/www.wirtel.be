## About me

![Me by my daughter](/me-draw.png)

I am live in Charleroi in Belgium. I am a freelancer, especially a Python expert. I like to share my knowledge with some talks. I have no personal project, excepted my small contributions to CPython.


I am also a [#fellow](https://www.python.org/psf/members/) of the Python Software Foundation and received a [Community Service Award](https://www.python.org/community/awards/psf-awards/#june-2016) from the Python Software Foundation.

This announce has been published [on the blog](http://pyfound.blogspot.be/2016/08/in-beginning-there-was-one-python-group.html) of the Python Software Foundation.

During the PyCon US 2017 in Portland, I have received my Award.
Thank you to the Python Software Foundation
