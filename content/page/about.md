## About me

I am live in Charleroi in Belgium. I am a freelancer, especially a Python expert. I like to share my knowledge with some talks. I have no personal project, excepted my small contributions to CPython.


I am also a [#fellow](https://www.python.org/psf/members/) of the Python Software Foundation and I have received a [Community Service Award](https://www.python.org/community/awards/psf-awards/#june-2016) from the Python Software Foundation.

This announce has been published on the blog of the Python Software Foundation. http://pyfound.blogspot.be/2016/08/in-beginning-there-was-one-python-group.html

I am also a former [Odoo](http://www.odoo.com) developer.
